# JavaFX-and-NIST
This application was originally supplied to us to apply NIST low impact security controls.
NIST security controls implemented include AU-3: Content of Audit Records, AU-8: Time Stamps, IA-2(1): Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Network Access to Privileged Accounts, AC-8: System Use Notification, AC-7: Unsuccessful Logon Attempts, and AU-5(2): Response to Audit Processing Failures | Real-Time Alerts.  Original file can be found under "Original File".  This program will not function until valid email credentials are re-entered.
This program should be free of vulnerabilities.
